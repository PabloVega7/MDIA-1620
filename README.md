# MDIA-1620
Pablo Vega's MDIA- 1620 code. 

3 things I learned during lesson #3: 
- What JavaScript is and what it was created for (web browsers).
- What JS is used for nowadays (non-web applications).
- What primitives are: JS primitives = data.



2 confusing things:
- "Git commit" was somewhat confusing to me because sometimes I had to "git add" to update what will be commited (file) and other times the file was already there. 
- "Git push" was confusing to make it work due to the authentication issues we had. Although I'm aware this is usually not difficult at all. 



I'm feeling: optimistic (hopefully this course won't be as complicated for me as I thought).

Main takeaway from MDIA's first class:
- "It's not that you don't know how to use a computer, it's just that you don't know how to think like one YET".

//Lesson 6
3 confusing things:
- Zero-based indexing: can be consusing at first when getting used to it and when trying to access elements and getting another result.
- Accessing and index that is larger than an array: results in undefined.
- Array methods: some methods modify arrays and others don't.
