# MDIA-1620
Pablo Vega's MDIA- 1620 code. 

"Aha" moments: 
- The better understanding of the word "interface".
- Learning to use the commands "cd" and "ls" after not getting it in the first and second try.
- Realizing how specific you have to be when working with computers.



Unclear things:
- How to navigate through Github.
- What is Github mainly used for? Other than hosting codes online.



I'm feeling: receptive.

Main takeaways from MDIA's first class:
- "It's not that you don't know how to use a computer, it's just that you don't know how to think like one YET".
- Coding is a language that takes time and practice to learn but learning it could open you countless oportunities and save you a lot of time when using a computer.
